# opengash for Google Analytics
If you have multiple websites using Google Analytics, you might wish to have a single screen where you could see how all of your websites are performing over several different periods of time.

That's what opengash is for. See this screenshot:

opengash is still a very immature project. I'm developing it mainly to learn software engineering and deployment.

opengash is built with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js). If you know how to run MEAN apps and wanna try this one:

1. download it
2. `cd` into `server`
3. `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. configure `server/config.js` 
5. `node server` while in `server`
6. Make sure a MongoDB server is running
7. Load the app in your browser.
